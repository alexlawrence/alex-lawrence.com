I am a software developer with knowledge and experience in architecture, automation, backend, frontend, operations, teaching, technical leadership and testing. Since 2007, my professional focus lies on full-stack web development. 

In most projects, I use JavaScript or TypeScript as language and Node.js as backend runtime. Wherever useful, I apply selected parts of DDD. The architectural patterns I am most interested in are Event-driven Architecture, CQRS and Event Sourcing. For the frontend, I professionally work with various libraries, such as React or lit-html. Personally, I favor to use native technologies, such as Web Components.

Most recently, I started with Rust and Kotlin as new programming languages and picked up selected concepts of Functional Programming. Since many years, I am a strong supporter for Free/Libre Open Source Software.
