I am a software developer with knowledge and experience in architecture, automation, backend, frontend, operations, teaching, technical leadership and testing. Since 2007, my professional focus lies on full-stack web development. 

In most projects, I use JavaScript as language and Node.js as backend runtime. Wherever useful, I apply selected parts of DDD. The architectural patterns I am most interested in are Event-driven Architecture, CQRS and Event Sourcing. For the frontend, I personally favor to use native technologies, such as Web Components. Professionally, I also work with various libraries and tools. 

Most recently, I started learning Rust as new programming language and picked up selected concepts of Functional Programming. Since many years, I am a strong supporter for Free/Libre Open Source Software.
