      This book explains and illustrates how to implement Domain-Driven Design, Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing. The goal is to build software that is behavior-rich, event-based, problem-centric, reactive, scalable and well-designed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong> is a concept that focuses on the problem space and its associated knowledge areas. <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong> separates a software into a write side and a read side. <strong>Event Sourcing</strong> is an architectural pattern that represents state as a sequence of immutable events. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The concepts are explained in theory and put into practice with standalone examples and a Sample Application. This is done without third-party software. The book comes with a source code bundle and supports interactive execution. All code is written in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and uses <strong>Node.js</strong> as runtime.
