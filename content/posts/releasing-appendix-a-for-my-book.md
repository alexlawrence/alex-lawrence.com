The latest version of my book ["Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing"](https://leanpub.com/implementing-ddd-cqrs-and-event-sourcing) includes an appendix on the use of static types. The examples are implemented in TypeScript.

As next step, I will start to work on another appendix about going into production. There, all exemplary code for persistence and messaging will be replaced with suitable existing technologies.
