      <description>This post summarizes some insights from my deep dive into TypeScript from when writing an appendix for my book. While I have been working with TypeScript for quite some time, most of the code I encountered was pretty trivial. The majority of the following aspects were new to me and helped me to understand the language better. Also, writing a lot of my book&amp;rsquo;s code again in TypeScript allowed me to identify potential downsides.</description>

      <description>Today, I released version 1.3.0 of my book &amp;ldquo;Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing&amp;rdquo;.
This release adds Appendix B: Going into production. The appendix uses EventStoreDB as Event Store, Redis for Read Models, RabbitMQ as Message Bus and NGINX as HTTP proxy.
Also, this release applies the following changes to the existing content:
 add section on frameworks to conclusion part fix line lengths of various code examples fix password hashing when changing user password simplify indexed storage component with partial updates introduce link to project overview from team management page shorten note example replace door locker example with message inbox example fix missing parts of TypeScript implementation  Buy the book on Leanpub</description>

      <description>The latest version of my book &amp;ldquo;Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing&amp;rdquo; includes an appendix on the use of static types. The examples are implemented in TypeScript.
As next step, I will start to work on another appendix about going into production. There, all exemplary code for persistence and messaging will be replaced with suitable existing technologies.

      <title>Domain Modeling by example</title>
      <link>https://www.alex-lawrence.com/posts/domain-modeling-by-example/</link>

      <description>This post illustrates a Domain Modeling process using a simple example. As first step, the actual problem is identified. Next, a solution approach is discovered. This is followed by the creation of an initial Domain Model. Afterwards, a first implementation is provided. Then, technical and logical challenges are discussed and solved. Also, the differences between a Domain Model and its implementation are explained. The post ends with a recommendation to use a problem-centric and model-driven approach, even for small projects.</description>

      <title>Using the filesystem for illustration purposes</title>

      <guid>https://www.alex-lawrence.com/posts/using-the-filesystem-for-illustration-purposes/</guid>
      <description>This post describes the approach of using the filesystem for illustrating the implementation of concepts related to persistence and messaging. Some of the explanations are put into the context of my book &amp;ldquo;Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing&amp;rdquo;. The approach is compared to the alternatives of using existing technologies as well as providing pseudo in-memory implementations. At the end, the post outlines the most relevant benefits and implications.
The approach Apart from Node.</description>

      <title>Why my book uses Node.js and JavaScript</title>

      <description>This post explains why I chose Node.js as runtime platform and JavaScript as programming language for my book &amp;ldquo;Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing&amp;rdquo;. The described reasons incorporate personal experience, the desired target audience, as well as platform and language characteristics. Also, the benefits and implications of static types are briefly discussed. Finally, the post closes with an outlook of future additions to the existing book.

      <description>This post explains my motivation for writing a book on DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing. It starts with outlining how I came in contact with the concepts. Then, it describes how I first applied the patterns accidentally and afterwards worked with them extensively. Finally, it presents the initial book idea, my personal progress throughout the years and the actual result.
First contact I first heard of Domain-Driven Design when I worked as a Senior Software Developer at AutoScout24.</description>

      <title>The financial cost of writing a book</title>

      <description>One essential question for every potential book author is: What does it financially cost to write a book? Obviously, there is no universal answer to this. Furthermore, in most cases, the goal is to not only cover the cost, but also to earn additional money. In any case, it is important to know what the financial cost of a book project is. Only then, one can decide whether it is worth to do it.</description>
